# CYD_Simplest_Internetradio with the ESP32-2432S028R (Cheap Yellow Display)
A simple Internet Radio is implemented in view lines of code. This is only 
possible thanks to the excellent AudioTools libraries from [Phil Schatzmann](https://github.com/pschatzmann)
and the open source MP3 codec by [Helix.](http://www.helixcommunity.org)
